    <h1>Briefly about me</h1>
    <p>
      A bite from a spider somehow granted teenager Peter Parker its arachnid
      abilities and instead of using them for personal gain, he decided to help
      others with them. An orphan living with his aunt, May Parker, the boy
      chose to wear a mask while fighting crime so as not to burden her with his
      actions.

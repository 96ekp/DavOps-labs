    <h1>Briefly about me</h1>
    <p>
      Calling himself Spider-Man and sporting a pair of web-shooting devices
      he’d constructed, Parker wound up in internet videos which attracted the
      attention of Tony Stark. The billionaire industrialist deduced Spider-
      Man’s secret identity and approached Parker at his and May’s home in
      Queens, New York with a request for aid from the hero in an upcoming
      confrontation with Captain America and a group of other rogue Avengers and
      associates. Parker was initially hesitant to even admit his secret career
      as Spider-Man, but the thrill of adventure and Stark’s talk of
      responsibility drew him in and he accepted the invitation, as well as a
      new, high-tech costume and web-shooters.
